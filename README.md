## Abstract

Our VR application, Repair Base, is an educational tool geared towards anyone interested in repairing their own computer. According to a study conducted by Poll (2015), “Nine in ten (87%) college students use a laptop, notebook, or Chromebook computer every week in order to do their schoolwork. By comparison, 64% use a smartphone and 40% a tablet. 15% use a hybrid” (pg 10). With 87% of college students utilizing a laptop on a weekly basis, overtime they break down and need to be repaired to extend their lifespan. Repair Base will enable individuals to repair their own computers to extend the lifespan of the devices. This tool is being built on the OpenXR framework within the Unity Engine to ensure a first-person point of view as well as realistic experience. A frame work was also created to allow different simulations to be added in the future with ease. Along with the VR tool, a knowledge base with published step by step articles to utilize while working through the repairs. With Repair Base, the daunting task of at home computer repair can be made easy for everyone.
